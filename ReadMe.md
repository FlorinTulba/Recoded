# Recoding Experiments

* * *

This is a collection of **small projects** whose *solutions* were **rewritten (translated) in several programming languages**. The purpose of this approach is to *refresh/learn the notions from each of those languages*.

The list of the recoded projects considered so far:

- ***CountShapes*** - a tool for counting all possible triangles and (convex) quadrilaterals from geometric figures traversed by a number of lines. Counting accuracy was mathematically checked, except for the largest and most complex tested figure. Additionaly, this problem seems also suitable for applying parallelism and image processing
- ***UnionFind*** - a data structure with excellent performance used to build sets of elements and for establishing if 2 items belong to the same set. More details can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure)
