# What is the ratio of the matrix elements to be assigned to the GPU?
# The expected value is between 0 and 1.
# 0 means the CPU inspects the whole matrix.
# Value x in (0,1] means that the GPU processes C = ceiling(x*M) matrix rows,
# unless C < MinElemsForGPU, where M is the total number of matrix elements.
