### Figures tested by the shape counter

* * *

The 4 existing figures can be directly interpreted by the Matlab/Octave implementation of the shape counter.

The interpreter should work with new test figures as long as these:

- are drawn with black on white background
- leave a fair amount of unused space near the image borders
- points' labels (which are optional) need to be of red color
- contain only minor imperfections

There is no need to name the points (intersections). The interpreter assigns anyway new names to all these points and displays the figure with the new labels.
