### Text descriptions of the figures tested by the shape counter

* * *

There are 2 description files (sharing a common file name prefix) for 4 test figures from the parent folder:

- one file is automatically generated by the figure interpreter (written in Matlab/Octave) and contains **.png** before the **.txt** file extension. The intersections were labeled differently by the interpreter, compared to the labels from the corresponding interpreted figure. This proves that the implemented algorithm counting the shapes is not influenced by the order of the points/lines
- the other file is manually generated and respects the exact labels from the figures. It contains no **.png** before the **.txt** file extension.

The description file &#39;count25651shapes.png.txt&#39; refers to figure &#39;../count25651shapes.png&#39; and was generated by the Matlab/Octave figure interpreter.

Any description file contains a row for each line from the figure. Such a row presents the points from the figure traversed by the considered line. The points must be in the order they appear on that line.

New test files can be generated based on the mentioned rules.
