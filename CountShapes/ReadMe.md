### Counting triangles and quadrilaterals within geometric figures traversed by a number of lines

* * *

The exact mathematical relations providing the count of those shapes within a figure are quite difficult to infer for complex figures. So this tool can be used as a validator for such relations.

The problem can serve also for refreshing image processing and parallelism techniques (implemented in Matlab/Octave, Python or C++ with some help offered by [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/), [OpenMP](http://www.openmp.org/), [CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) / [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/)).

These are the tested figures:
